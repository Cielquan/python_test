Contribution through Github Pull Requests

This section will guide you through the process of contributing through

If you are unsure about things regarding your contribution just open a pull request or

Please write meaningful commit messages and if you work on an issue please add its id in

Contribution to the Documentation
---------------------------------

Contribution to the documentation is the easiest way to get started to contribute to
``{{cookiecutter.project_name}}``. You can look in the :repo:`Github issue tracker <issues>`
for issues with the ``Documentation`` label and try to solve them.


Contribution to Code
--------------------

Contribution to Code is a way to influence the direction of this project proactively.

First you need an issue to work on. Just pick one from the
:repo:`Github issue tracker <issues>` and get started.

.. note::
    If you are a first time contributor issues with the ``Good First Issue`` label are
    good ones to get started with.
