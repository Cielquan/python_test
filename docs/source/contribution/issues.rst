How to submit a bug report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section will guide you through the process of submitting a bug report, which helps
others to understand your report, reproduce the problem and eventually find related
issues.

Bugs are tracked at the aforementioned
`Github issue tracker <https://github.com/cielquan/python_test-cielquan/issues>`__
where you can create a new issue and choose the ``Bug Report`` option. Through the
option your issue's body is automatically filled with the
`Bug Report template <https://github.com/Cielquan/python_test-cielquan/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/.bug-report.md>`__.
By filling this template you make it easier for others to understand and help with or
fix the problem.

Explain your topic as detailed as possible to help others reproduce the problem:

- The more details the better.
- Use a clear, concise and descriptive title.
- Describe the exact steps to take to reproduce the problem.
- Describe the behavior you observed following the steps above.
- Describe the behavior you expected instead while following the steps above.

If:

- you have specific examples to reproduce the problem like config/code snippets, files
  or links to a Github project

.. CHANGE ME

- the problem is an error which unexpectedly occurs and you ran the command again with
  the ``--debug`` option to get a more information

please include them or make a `Gist <https://gist.github.com/>`__ and include its link.

You can also provide more context by asking yourself these questions:

- Did the problem just start happening recently after an update or something?
- If so can you reproduce the problem with older versions?
- Does the problem occur with older or new python versions also?
- Does the problem occur every time and is reliably reproducible?
- If not how often does it occur? Please provide as many details as possible.

The template also asks for some info about your environment:

- What **version** of ``python_test-cielquan`` do you use?
- Which **OS** are you using and which **version**?
- Which **python version** are you using?
